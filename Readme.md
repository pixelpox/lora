## Introduction

This project is to explore what LoraWAN is about and how it can be used in a
hobby environment.

## Current Issue

Currently there is no LoraWAN gateway where I live so I am taking on the task of building my own.

## Whats involved?

LoraWAN first needs a gateway that operates on the xxxMHz frequency here in the UK. Second a node is needed to send information to the loraWAN.
